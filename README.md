Final paper of the Bachelor Honours Class

This paper compares the effectiveness of different government measures in the Netherlands to contain Covid-19. We suggest an innovative approach based on modifying the existing constant pa-
rameter SIR model to make it dynamic. After validating our model with optimisation in Python, we use the validated model to measure the overall effectiveness of government measures based on 
attening waves of Covid-19 cases, and subsequently estimate the contribution of individual government measures in attening the curve using Tikhonov regularisation method.
