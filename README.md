This paper compares the effectiveness of different government measures in the Netherlands to contain Covid-19. We suggest an innovative approach based on modifying the existing constant parameter SIR model to make it time-varying. After validating our model with optimisation in Python, we use the validated model to measure the overall effectiveness of government measures based on attenuating waves of Covid-19 cases, and subsequently estimate the contribution of individual government measures in attenuating the curve using Tikhonov regularisation method.
